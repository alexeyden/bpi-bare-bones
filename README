Experimenting with bare bones Rust programming on Banana PI (quite old dual-core ARMv7a board).

Contents:
* src/
  Sources of the primary image written in Rust

* tools/mksunxiboot.c
  A little tool stolen from u-boot sources that prepends eGON header to the boot image.
  Banana PI boot loader firmware expects this header at 8K offset on the SDCARD.

* chainloader/
  A tiny UART chainloader that can be flashed to SDCARD instead of the primary image.
  It reads an image hex dump in Motorola SREC 32-bit format from UART and then transfers control
  to the address given in S7 record. The only supported SREC record types are S0 (silently ignored),
  S3 and S7.
